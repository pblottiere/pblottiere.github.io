# Contributions

Since 2016, I have been actively contributing to the field of Geographic
Information Systems (GIS) as a core committer in several FOSS (Free and Open
Source Software) projects. My involvement in this community has allowed me to
play a part in the development and evolution of several tools and libraries
that are now used by thousands of professionals and enthusiasts in the GIS
field around the world.

In particular Iâ€™ve been a core committer for several years for QGIS, a major
open-source GIS project with over 300 contributors and thousands of active
users worldwide. I'm also part of the voting community, where I help make
decisions about the project's direction.
